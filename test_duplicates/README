Something wierd is going on where the met branches are made even though I moved everything out of the way.
Vince fixed it by just cp'ing ScanTest.cc, ScanTest.h, doAllTest.C, txt_to_tree.sh, and the desired formatted_met_corrections file to a fresh dir.


Process all should make the txt files, merge them, format it, and move it all to the unmerged dir.
txt_to_tree should read in the formatted file and create a tree

OR USE THESE BASH COMMANDS

       cwelke@uaf-7 ~/ianD_ntuplechecks/duplics$ cat formatted_met_corrections.txt > formatted_met_corrections_combined.txt
